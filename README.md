# lk_bachelor_data
This repository contains all important data that is related to the experiment of my bachelor's thesis, including the feature models, the performance measurements, the learned performance-influence models, and the evaluation results.

Note that ...

- Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
- Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

... are the six final classifiers that we considered in our experiment.

At first, we also wanted to cover...

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Bayesian Gaussian Mixture (BGM)
- Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC)
- Extra Trees Classifer (ETC)

..., however, due to high computational cost, we dropped those four classifiers later on in our final consideration. Thus, some data is still stored in this repository. Simply ignore it.
